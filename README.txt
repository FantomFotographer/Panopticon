Panopticon -- software for automating panorama capture.
================================================================================


Panopticon?

  The name is taken from the design for a prison in which the guards can see
everything from a central location.  This software assists you in capturing
images of everything around by panning the camera for you.


History?

  Bored, I found photo stitching software and created some handheld panoramas.
Quickly realizing the limitations of handheld shooting, I decided to automate
the process -- as cheaply as possible.


Who is this for?

  Not for pros.  There are some great high-end solutions out there for anyone
willing to spend the money.  Are you a photo student or semipro with a decent
SLR?  Probably not up to your standards either.  You can find something decent
for around 300USD.  Cheapskate / experimenter / hobbyist with a point and
shoot?  Bingo!


Let's get serious, what can you do with this?

  Gorgeous panoramas. Spectacular fisheyes.  Little planets.  Immersion.
Extend camera timers.  Extreme time lapse.  General remote controlled
photography.  The possibilities are limited only by your imagination, how much
battery power you can scrounge, and the size of your largest memory card.


Features?

  Automatic 2 axis panning of a camera, configured via remote control.
  Quick angle mode:        
	Quick and easy 2 button access to the most commonly used angles.
  Center based capture:    
	Capture a specified area around the center and level point.
  Specific angle capture:  
	Enter the starting and ending angles for horizontal and vertical capture.
  Manual mode:             
	Manually pan the camera and select your start and endpoints visually.
  Repeat mode:             
	Set your program to repeat a specified number of times.
  Delayed mode:            
	Specify a pause before running or between repeats.
  Camera keep-alive:       
	Take action periodically to keep a camera from powering down.
  Camera autofocus-assist: 
	Half-tap the shutter button to force an autofocus.
  Most everything can be reconfigured in the field via remote, such as
   horizontal and vertical field of view, and amount of overlap with previous
   images.


How do I build one?

  There are really 3 aspects to building one.  Electronics, software, and
mechanical hardware.  It's all very simple.   This software is provided for you,
and is a good starting point.  It runs on the Arduino platform(or any AVR chip
you want adapt it to), which makes interfacing with a remote and servos trivial.
The mechanical aspects are left up to you.  There are many ways you can build a
frame to support your camera, and you'll want to read up a bit on lenses and
parallax before you begin.  The wiki can point you to a few ideas and examples.
