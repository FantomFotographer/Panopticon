Panopticon remote control menus
================================================================================

  The default menus are based on the layout of a small generic remote with the
following layout, but you're free to use any remote and modify anything as you
see fit.

Commands and examples
================================================================================


A. QUICK angles and directions, using numbers like a dpad
   (no function selection needed, always ready for instant action)
	1. Press start angle 1 through 9
	2. Press stop angle 1 through 9
        3. program begins with no further entry

	ex. 4 6 = pan left to right from 180 to 0deg, 1 row
	ex  9 1 = pan right to left and bottom to top from 0x0 to 180x180
	ex  6 8 = pan right to left and top to bottom from 90x0 to 0x90
	ex  5 5 = take a single pic at 90x90 dead center


B. CENTER Based pan angles.
	1. Press eq  (Think: equal around center)
	2. enter 3 digit x axis width
	3. enter 3 digit y axis width
	4. Program begins

	ex. 180 x 090 = pan Xaxis 0 to 180 and Yaxis 45 to 135(90deg wide)
        ex. 090 x 000 = pan X 45 to 135, pan Y to 90 only (1 row of images)


C. SPECIFIC angle entry.
	1. Press UP arrow  (Think: up for brains)
	2. enter 3 digit x axis start point
	3. enter 3 digit y axis start point
	4. enter 3 digit x axis end point
	5. enter 3 digit y axis end point
	6. Program begins

	ex. 066 120 033 060 = pan Xaxis 66 to 33 while paning y from 120 to 60.


D. MANUAL agnle selection.
	1.  Press Down arrow  (Think: lower for hands)
	2.  Use numbers as a dpad 2=up 8=dow 4=left 6=right to move servos
             to desired position.
	3.  Press 5 to select current position as start angles
	4.  Use numbers as dpad to move to desired position
	5.  Press 5 to select position as destination angle.
	6. Program begins.

	ex.  move to start position, 5, move to stop posit, 5.  Camera takes
              necassary images to photograph entire range.
	ex.  move to position, 5, 5.  Camera takes 1 images at current angle.


E. REPEATing x times
	1. Press rept.  (Think: repetition)
        2. enter 3 digit number of times to repeat next action
        3. program next action
        4. next action repeats. after the next action finishes all repeating
            actions, it goes to zero.

	ex. 003 = repeat 3 times


F. DELAYed startup
	1. Press pause (Think: pause before beginning)
	2. Enter 3 digit number, in seconds.
	3. Waits n seconds before begining routing, AND between repeating
            actions.  Resets to zero when done.

	ex. 060 = wait 1 minute before taking photos.  If repeats enabled, also
             wait 1min between sets of photos.


J. PROGRAMMING your camera characteristics.
	1.  Press FF (>>) , 3, 9, 7 , 1.  This combo enters camera prog mode
	2.  Enter 2 digit number of seconds your camera takes to store images,
             EX. 06 for six seconds.
	3.  Enter 3 digit camera sleep timer (should be around half of your
             camera's timer, calculated as a mulplier of 8)
             EX. 7 = 56 seconds, 8=64 seconds 
	4.  Enter 3 digit hfov
	5.  Enter 3 digit vfov
	6.  Enter 3 digit horizontal overlap
	7.  Enter 3 digit vertical overlap


K. PROGRAMMING your servo characteristics.
	1.  Press FF  (>>) , 3, 9, 7 , 2.  This combo enters servo prog mode
	2.  Enter 3 digit vertical servo maximum degrees (ex. 172)
	3.  Enter 3 digit horizontal servo maximum degrees
	4.  Enter 3 digit shutter servo rest position
	5.  Enter 3 digit shutter servo half-tap position
	6.  Enter 3 digit shutter servo full tap position
	7.  Enter 2 digit servo speed.


L. SERVO TUNING
(WARNING!!! you WILL destroy your servos if you repeatedly hit or strain against
 the endpoints.  Make sure to back off several stops from an endpont to allow
 for the inevitable power and temperature changes)

	1.  Press FF  (>>) , 3, 9, 7 , 3.  This combo enters servo tuning mode
	2.  Press press 2(up) to increase MINimum timing, 8(down) to decrease.
             You should target just shy of the end stop.  Make sure your servo is
             not twitching or straining, and back off 10 steps before continuing
	3.  Press press 2(up) to increase MAXimum timing, 8(down) to decrease.
             You should target just shy of the end stop.  Make sure your servo is
             not twitching or straining, and back off 10 steps before continuing
	4.  Press 5 to save and move on to next servo.
	5.  Repeat steps 4-6 for each servo


M. WORKAROUNDS for slow FOCUS camera problems.
	Some cameras are quicker to respond if the shutter is half-depressed for
         a moment before taking an image.  If some images have been blurry,
	 or some images were not captured(and you've already tried increasing the
         timing between images), your camera may benefit from this.
	1.  Press FF  (>>) , 3, 9, 7 , 6.

	result.  Beep.  halftap before picture for cams that dont focus quickly
         or at all before full snap

N. RESET TO FACTORY DEFAULTS (clear ALL configuration info)
	1.  Press FF (>>) , 3, 9, 0 , 9

	result.  system reboots, reseting all servo setings, servo tuning, camera
                 characteristics, and sound settings, to defaults.
